Divide posts into sections and implement voting for each of them. Great for list-type posts.

== Description ==

If you want to create a list-type post with, say, 21 links to something, you can use this plugin to change those links into separate sections. And the most important - your visitors could vote (+1/-1) for each of those sections separately.

This way you would see, which section/link is the most popular among your readers.

Current features:

*   Dividing posts into sections with shortcode [psv-section]
*	Voting for each section, with result of voting available immediately in the post

== Installation ==

1. Upload `post-section-voting` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use shortcode [psv-section section="123"]Section text[/psv-section] in your posts.
